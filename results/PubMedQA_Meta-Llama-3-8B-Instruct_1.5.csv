990," No, only 36% of new TB patients adhered to the treatment regimen, with 136 (28.2%) lost to follow-up. Factors influencing non-adherence included observation by family members and paying monthly service expenses above 450 RMB",0
991," No, as the study suggests that ultrasound examination was unable to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, and absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernos",0
992," No, four-view radiographs do not have significant advantages over two-view radiographs in terms of diagnostic value or agreement, and they result in significantly higher radiation effective doses and charges. Two-view radiographs (anteroposterior and lateral only) may",0
993," No, in this study only 1.3% colorectal cancers were missed in the adenoma phase.
