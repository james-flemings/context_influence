977," Yes, the Internet could be used to provide sex education and information to young people, particularly those who already use the Internet. The GUM website idea was well received, and many students expressed an interest in a 'question line' service. However,",0
978," No, eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol does not represent a good prognostic factor for bladder cancer after radical cystectomy, as the outcome of patients in this group did not differ significantly from that of an age- and tumor-stage-matched",0

983," Yes. In children with a family history of atopy, breast-feeding is associated with a lower rate of illness, particularly in the first year of life, and throughout the first three years of life, illnesses such as gastroenteritis, lower respiratory",0
984," Yes, but the optimal dose depends on the tumor size and location. For central tumors, a higher dose (160 Gy) appears to be more effective in achieving local control, while for smaller peripheral tumors, a lower dose (100 Gy) might be",0
985," No, the dimensions of the middle turbinate are not changed by septoplasty. However, there is a correlation between the angle of the septum and the middle turbinate total area on the deviated side after septoplasty. Note: The",0
986," Yes, a 20-minute patient coaching session significantly reduced disparities in cancer pain control between minority and white patients. These findings have implications for improving pain outcomes in minority patients with cancer. [1]

Implications: Patients with prior benign prostate biopsies may be candidates for radical perine",0

989," No. The data do not support the policy assumption that Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared with non-indigenous Australians. Elderly Indigenous Australians do experience a higher burden of illness, but this is not necessarily a result of aging prematurely. The life expectancy at older",0
990," No, not all TB patients adhere to treatment. In fact, nearly one-third of new TB patients in this study missed at least one dose of medication or one follow-up examination. Factors that contributed to non-adherence included not being supervised by family members",0
991," Yes, ultrasound is useful in assessing the extent of the tumor and invasion into the corpora, particularly in evaluating the invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum. Ultrasound is also helpful in measuring the maximum tumor thickness.",0
992," No. Conclusion: Oblique radiographs do not add diagnostic value in the evaluation of adolescents with suspected spondylolysis. Radiation exposure is significantly higher with four-view studies, and the charge is significantly increased. Therefore, omission of oblique views",0
