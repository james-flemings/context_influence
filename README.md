# Estimating Privacy Leakage of Augmented Contextual Knowledge in Language Models 

This is the official repository for the work "Estimating Privacy Leakage of Augmented Contextual Knowledge in Language Models." 

## Environment Setup
We used Python 3.10.12 in our implementation. Run the following lines to set up the evironment: 

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Evaluations

Text generations used in the paper can be found in `results`. To reproduce the main results for `CNN-DM` and `PubMedQA`, run the following:

```bash
bash scripts/cnn_dailymail/main_results_run.sh
bash scripts/pubmed_qa/main_results_run.sh
```

If you want to obtain your own text generations for evaluating context privacy leakage on `CNN-DM` and `PubMedQA`, run the following:

```bash
bash scripts/cnn_dailymail/text_generation_run.sh
bash scripts/pubmed_qa/text_generation_run.sh
```
